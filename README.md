# MealPrepApp-CS3203

  PlatePlanner is a mobile app that will compile your recipes, suggest meal plans, and make a shopping list for you to make the transition from student life to adult life easier.
  Students are used to using either their school's meal plan, their parents food, or eating out. Even if many students can make food, they don't know how to plan their meals for
  the week. This would assist them in planning their meals for the week.

  Installation: This will be available on the App Store and Google Play. Please search PlatePlanner.
